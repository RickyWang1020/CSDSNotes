# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble sort

- In every iteration, (if want to sort in ascending order) the largest element in the unsorted subarray will be swapped to the end of array

- Outer loop: `0` to `n-1`; Inner loop: `0` to `n-i-1` if there are already `i+1` numbers "floated" to the end of array

- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`

## Merge sort

Time Complexity: `O(nlogn)`

## Heap sort

## Insertion sort

## Selection sort

## Quick sort

Average Time Complexity: `O(nlogn)`

Worst Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`

## Bucket sort
