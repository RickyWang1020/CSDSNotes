# Heap

## Array Representation of Binary Tree

- **Complete BT**: the second last level is full, and the last level from left to right is completely filled (i.e., in the array representation, there is no gap in between nodes)
- **Full BT**: the leaf nodes all have the same heights
- Full BT is also a Complete BT

## Min/Max Heap Concepts

- Is a **Complete Binary Tree**
- Min heap: Parent Node is Always `<=` Children Nodes; Max heap: Parent Node is Always `>=` Children Nodes
- If `N` is the parent node's index, then `2N` is left child node, `2N+1` is right child node

## Inserting an element (Max heap)

## Deleting an element (Max heap)

## Building a Heap

- Build a Heap First (Put elements into a "Binary Tree", or just an Array)
